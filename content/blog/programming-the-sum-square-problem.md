I recently watched an interesting video on the [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A) YouTube channel where [Matt Parker](http://standupmaths.com/) discuses the 'Sum Square Problem'.  The video can be seen below.

The video mentions that the problem is only solved for where n is less than ~300.  Over the next week I will be attempting to solve this problem for a larger n than anyone has ever solved before!
