I'm a 21-year-old programmer currently living in San Francisco. I'm a student at Purdue University where will receive my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a focus in Software Engineering. When I'm not writing softeare, I enjoy volunteering with FIRST Robotics teams teaching high school students how to program and how to attack design problems simply and effectively.

For a closer look at the professional work I've done, check out my [resume](/ben_weis_resume.pdf). If you're interested in reaching out to me, feel free to [contact me](mailto:bweis96@gmail.com). Thanks!
