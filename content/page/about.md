I'm a 21-year-old computer science student at Purdue University where I will receive my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a focus in Software Engineering.

When I'm not writing software, I enjoy volunteering with [FIRST Robotics](http://www.firstinspires.org) teams teaching high school students how to program and how to attack design problems simply and effectively.

For a closer look at the professional work I've done, check out my [resume](/ben_weis_resume.pdf). If you're interested in reaching out to me, shoot me an [e-mail](mailto:bweis96@gmail.com).
